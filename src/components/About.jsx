                        My name is Lady Meek. I am a full-stack (frontend & backend) freelance website developer in the San Diego area. 
                        Iâ€™m a recent graduate of Dev Code Camp. For frontend development, I have knowledge and experience with React.js, 
                        WordPress and Shopify. Fluent in the languages of Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, 
                        I enjoy building visually creative, easy to use and stylish websites for motivated individuals!
